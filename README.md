The solution is written in python.\
There are two versions: the first is in the folder python (general, robust solution, flexible to changes), the second is in the folder python2 (significantly faster, but not general and robust, taking advantage of the patterns' structure, but not flexible to changes, i.e. adding new patterns)\
Either version is run the same way:
1. Download the files from the python (or python2) folder and place them in a folder of Your choice preserving the file structure.\
2. You have to provide the input.bin and output.bin files with the test images and put them in the same folder as main.py.\
3. The solution can be run from main.py with a standard python interpreter.\
3.1. If using python distribution with IDLE, open main.py from it and hit F5 - status messages are displayed in the console.\
3.2. If using command line interface, navigate to the folder in which main.py is, and type: python3 main.py\
Status messages are displayed in the console.
